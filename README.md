Creating a web application with \***\*CodeIgniter 4\*\*** is really easy. In
this series of articles I put the emphasis on the \***\*PHP\*\*** code and
not on the installation of CI, nor on the look of the web pages. If you
haven't already, start by [installing
CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html).

You can install it on a test server or on your personal computer. In the
examples in this article, I'm using MAMP (Apache, MySQL, and PHP on
macOS) with a virtual server
[http://ci4.test:8888](http://ci4.test:8888/) that points to the
directory **/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/ci4.test/public**.

First, if your website is not in english, you can install the
[translation files](https://github.com/codeigniter4/translations) for
your language in the directory
**/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/ci4.test/app/Language/**.
